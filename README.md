# external-dx11-overlay

Allows an external overlay to render inside a game as a DX11 render hook. Originally made for BlishHUD and Guild Wars 2.
It can easily be changed to work for any game with any overlay.

# How to use

For simple steps without having to compile anything: see the [Simple User Guide](https://github.com/SorryQuick/external-dx11-overlay/blob/master/Simple-User-Guide.md)

There are four steps to make this work.

- Compile this repo and get the dll.
- Compile a forked version of BlishHUD from https://github.com/SorryQuick/Blish-HUD
- If you are on Linux/Mac, you need to somehow get BlishHUD launched into your wine prefix. A quick way to do this (which probably won't work with steam) is to run something like this:
  ``WINEFSYNC=1 WINEPREFIX=<prefix> <wine binary> "Blish HUD.exe"``. With the same prefix and wine binary you used to launch the game (eg proton's wine binary).
- You need to load this DLL into the game's process. It will react well with any LoadLibraryW loader. You can also just google or search github for any dll injector out there and run it in the same prefix just like Blish. Eventually, this could support other existing loaders like arcdps. I've been using https://github.com/SorryQuick/Gw2-Simple-Addon-Loader
  Alternatively, you can install the [nexus version](#nexus-integration) of this addon and it will all be managed automatically. You can download the [Nexus addon loader &amp; manager here](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus).
- Texture Sharing must be enabled. Usually this means with proton and a recent version of DXVK.

# Compiling

``cargo +nightly build --release``

# Nexus Integration

This project optionally supports integration with the [Nexus](https://github.com/zerthox/nexus) addon loader & manager. When built with the `nexus` feature, it provides many benefits and simplifies installation and usage.

## Benefits of Nexus Integration

- **Simplified Installation**: Just drop the DLL in your Gw2 addons directory
- **User-Friendly Interface**: ImGui-based configuration window with file browser
- **Automatic Management**: Nexus handles addon loading, unloading, and dependency management
- **Quick Access menu**: Icon opens the configuration window, with alternative keyboard shortcut (ALT+SHIFT+1) to open the configuration window
- **Persistent Settings**: Executable path and launch preferences are automatically saved when selected.

## Building with Nexus Support

To build with Nexus integration enabled:

```bash
cargo build --features nexus --release
```

## Using with Nexus

1. Build the project with the `nexus` feature enabled
2. Place the resulting DLL in your Gw2 addons directory
3. Launch Guild Wars 2 (don't forget to have Nexus installed)
4. Enable the "Blish HUD overlay loader" addon in Nexus, in the **installed** addons tab
5. Click the newly added icon (somewhere in the top-left of the screen) or use ALT+SHIFT+1 to open the configuration window
6. Browse and select your BlishHUD executable
7. Launch BlishHUD from the interface

## Nexus vs Traditional Method

| Feature       | Nexus Integration         | Traditional Method         |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Installation  | Drop DLL in addons folder | Manual DLL injection       |
| Configuration | GUI with file browser     | Manual configuration files |
| Startup       | Automatic via Nexus       | Manual loader execution    |

# Current status

A lot of the core issues have been solved and it should now work pretty well.
If you encounter any problem, create an issue on github.
